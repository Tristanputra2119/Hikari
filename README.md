# Hikari Editor

## A Simple Notepad/Text Editor Using WinUI 3

Hikari Editor is built using the .NET framework as the base language, Edge WebView2 for text preview, and WinUI 3 for icons, text, and the user interface.

This project is inspired by the UI design of [Himeyama](https://github.com/himeyama) on GitHub.
